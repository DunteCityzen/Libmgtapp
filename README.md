## Disclaimer
On the vercel link you might experience problems adding new items(members, transactions and books). Probably due to an issue that occured with the database during deployment.
However, by cloning the repository and taking care of the prerequisites in the requirements.txt file, and hosting it locally, everything should run just fine.
